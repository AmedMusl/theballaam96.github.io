		<h1>Practice ROM 1.3.3 Features List</h1>
		<p>Since 1.4 is going to involve a <a href="https://twitter.com/tjballaam/status/1374472190704320512">large scale controls/UI overhaul</a>, I haven't really put much time into a features list and something official for 1.3.3 isn't reallly worth it all things considered.<br>That being said, I understand the desire for a features list/controls for 1.3.3 until 1.4 comes out, so here is a basic HTML page for that</p>
		<h3>Interface</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Open up the pause menu and press D-Up to access a tools menu that allows you to modify various in-game aspects</li>
			<ul>
				<li>To close, press D-Up again or close the pause menu with Start/B</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Use the analog stick to navigate the menus</li>
			<li>Use the A Button to active the functionality of a menu item (eg. A to warp to map, A to toggle flag state, A to set watch)</li>
			<li>Use the L Button to speed up scrolling speed</li>
			<li>To change "screens" (essentially just a way to segment controls), press Z/R</li>
			<ul>
				<li>The screens are as follows:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Screen 1: Set 'Important Flags', Savestates, Watches/Miscellaneous items</li>
					<li>Screen 2: Warp to map</li>
					<li>Screen 3: Control how the timer words</li>
					<li>Screen 4: Toggle flags for individual bananaports</li>
					<li>Screen 5: File Status, Cheats</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<h3>Savestates</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Savestates aren't 100% the savestates you may be used to with Emulators/Wii U Virtual console. They store some key variables that emulate most of what users want savestates for</li>
			<li>To save a state, select "Save State"</li>
			<li>To load a state, select "Load State" (This cannot be performed until a state has been saved)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>There are two variants of this</li>
				<ul>
					<li>"From Position" loads you back in from the map and position where you saved your savestate</li>
					<li>"From Exit" loads you back in from the entrance you entered the map from where you saved your savestate</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<li>Savestate functionality is prevented in certain maps</li>

			</ul>
		</ul>
		<h3>Warp to Map</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Allows you to warp to most maps in the game</li>

			</ul>
			<li>Each map is segmented into a level (eg. Dungeon will be in "Castle", Llama Temple will be in "Aztec")</li>
			<li>In some cases, you can warp to a specific entrance for maps that are quite large, these will be stated in the map name</li>
